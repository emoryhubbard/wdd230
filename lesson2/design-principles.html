                In nature, there some kinds of objects that you simply don’t see. You won’t find unbalanced rocks, hills, or trees with tops bigger than their bottoms. If you do see one, you will get the sensation that it is about to fall over. In a design—where there are no physical laws like gravity—this same sensation of being unbalanced can happen. One solution is to use the principle of repetition. It is used here to fill the empty space beneath the chocolate bar by repeating bits of two different colors. Because repetition can add or take away visual weight, it can be used for more than achieving balance—it can be used to direct where the viewer’s eyes go. This allows you to create or prevent focal points. For example, if the empty space beneath the chocolate was filled with just one or two bits, it would create another focal point because those bits would stand out more. Since they were repeated it directed the viewer’s eyes to the more important information on the page instead, like the candy bar itself.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>

                Anything we do in design is achieved through contrast. It is the easiest way to make focal points in a composition, giving the viewer “stopping points” for their eyes to rest on as they scan the page. When you notice an area of high contrast in a design—for example, the contrast in size between the all-caps text on this website and the rest of the text—you will find a focal point. The main focal point of a design is usually area of highest contrast. This site uses contrast again with the yellow circle at the bottom to create a secondary focal point, guiding the viewer’s eyes to scroll down further and learn more.

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Hyer</p>
            <a href="https://flyhyer.com/">flyhyer.com</a>
            <div class="has-img"><img src="images/Hyer.jpg" alt="hyer website"></div>
            <p>
                A viewer doesn’t control where their eyes go on a page—the designer does. He establishes a visual hierarchy which emphasizes certain elements of the composition over others. On the Hyer website the viewer’s eyes are first directed to the largest type, then the type below, and then the type at the bottom. The plane takes the viewer’s attention next, which leads to the menu buttons at the top right. The last component of this hierarchy is the Hyer logo at the top left. Each element has an established order given to it by the designer by using design principles like contrast and repetition.
