            <h3>White Oak Chamber Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>The White Oak Chamber is a group of businesses and individuals that seek to promote the welfare of the community and local companies of White Oak, MD. Events and programs are managed by its members to help foster greater activity in the town, as well as contribute to promoting local businesses and organizations.</p>
            <p>One of the goals is to increase the number of shoppers entering the White Oak Shopping Center on a monthly basis, with events designed by local retailer members of the White Oak Chamber for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Another goal is to establish a greater awareness of, and appreciation for, the small family-owned businesses that make up much of the town's restaurant industry. Some are receiving great reviews for their fine examples of international cuisine. Through advertising among other members of the Chamber, we are seeking to increase their presence to consumers in the area and beyond.</p>
