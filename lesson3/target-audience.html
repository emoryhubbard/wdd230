            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>The White Oak Chamber Site will receive a variety of visitors with differing demographic information, such as age and income. In order to identify more specific usage scenarios for the site, we have built two personas or model individuals that represent what a typical user may be like.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-grid" id="domain-grid">
            <h3>The Commercial Persona</h3>
            <p>From the main site-planning document, the purpose of the site was introduced as helping to promote the goal of increased awareness of local small businesses. To accomplish this, advertising of those businesses will be promoted by the individual members of the White Oak Chamber, as well as through this site.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, many site visitors will be small businesses looking to see how they can advertise for each other. The White Oak Chamber site will contain advertising to help promote member businesses that they can find in use in their stores, as well as contact information to allow them to post their own advertising that they would like to share.</p>
            <p>The commercial persona is a typical visitor of this category.</p>
            <p>Their age will range from early 20s to late 50s. Their income will range from $40,000 to $100,000. They will have a Bachelor's Degree in a field such as Marketing, with some experience in the topic already. In addition, this persona is married with a family to help support, and a high workload. They will typically be accessing the site from a desktop</p>
            <p>Scenarios:</p>
            <p>"Where can I find their contact information? We need to send our company's updated site and advertising links to be republished."In such a case, the site should provide clear and efficient means to allow member businesses to find how to update their information. It should also provide an easy and responsive form of contact in case any difficulties should arise.</p>
            <p>"How can we join and get these businesses to help us in our advertising efforts?" In this case there should be easy to see where they can sign up. In addition to this sign-up page, there should be a FAQ or similar page designed to explain how they can submit requests for other members to advertise for them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-grid" id="logo-grid">
            <h3>The Consumer Persona</h3>
            <p>Just as there is a commercial persona seeking to promote and advertise their business through the site, there will be a consumer persona that receives that advertising as they visit the site.</p>            
            <p>This will be a person in their early 20s to late 30s who has entered a local business and followed a link or QR code they saw inside from their mobile device. Their income will range from $25,000 to $50,000. They don't have a degree but they have received certification for their job. They will not be experienced with the topic, but they will be experienced at visiting other sites they have scanned before. They will not be married and have no family to support.</p>
            <p>"That restaurant looks interesting. What is their menu like?" The consumer persona has been visiting clothing store, and while waiting for checkout noticed a poster with an Ethiopian restaurant being advertised. In this scenario the site should directly go to a posting containing menu information, allowing an idea of the cuisine to be conveyed.</p>
            <p>"What is an escape room? Where can I find out more?" In this scenario a shopper was waiting in front of a local store and noticed a poster advertising an adventurous experience with puzzle-solving elements and wanted more information. In this case, the site should take her to the posting that is associated with the escape room member business, as well as links for additional information, like game length, types, and rules on their own site.</p>
            <p>"Where can I get the map for this trail?" At a local park, a visitor has seen a poster with a link to the White Oak Chamber Site containing the maps she wants. The site should take her directly to this map from the posted link. Advertising for member businesses can appear on this page as long as it doesn't interfere with the map.</p>
