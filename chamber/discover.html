            <p>White Oak is most well-known for being the location of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. This facility was shutdown back in 1994, but the property remains in use by the federal government. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has its headquarters occupying that property. Another major landmark is the Enclave Apartments. Earlier these apratments were called the Point. They have been around since the 1960s. The complex consists of 3 large, 20-story buildings, visible from anywhere in town.

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>White Oak's location can be most easily identified by finding the capital beltway of Washington, D.C. The Northern half of the beltway has two major exits, both of which intersect at White Oak. New Hampshire Ave (MD 650) and Columbia Pike (29) are these two major intersecting roads, both coming from the beltway. That is where you can find the largest commercial center and largest apartment complex in White Oak as well. These are accessible on New Hampshire Ave itself.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White Oak, as an unincorporated community, as no official defined boundaries according to Montgomery County. Quant Acres is considered a subdivision of White Oak, and is home to the house of Atlus Lacy Quaintance. She is known for being an Entomologist who worked for the Maryland Agricultural College, and eventually the USDA. During World War II, a TB-25D bomber crashed near Quaint Acres resulting in the loss of all four lives on board. This same subdivision was also the home of Rachel Carson, author of Silent Spring, who helped ban DDT through her book.
